# Cyber Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling Lab

## Project Overview
This cyber risk assessment and threat modeling lab simulates a real-world security evaluation lifecycle for a web application. In this project I will design a login portal using Flask, then perform vulnerability assessments, implement patches, and test the patches to see if they mitigated any vulnerabilities.

---

## Objectives
- Build a web application (login page) using Flask
- Conduct a STRIDE threat model for the application
- Perform vulnerability scans with the tools Nmap, Nikto, and OWASP ZAP
- Implement security hardening controls
- Validate improvements using the same tools

---

## Planning and Architecture

### Network Architecture
- Kali Linux (Attacker/Testing VM)
- Ubuntu (Web app design and deployment)
- Internet
